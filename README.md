# PS3-Executable-Rebuilder
Rebuild SPRX and SELF from ELF and PRX in memory 

This project unfortunately will not conclued itself as my PS3 is dead but I thought this would be a great project 

Why this project 
Well I recently was using IDA de remake Executable on PC from memory which allowed me to better see the excutable in ida and also allowed me to patch security on some executable.
I thought this would be cool on ps3 as we have all the needed information on PS3DevWiki.
